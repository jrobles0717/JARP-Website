    <p class="paragraph">Hello everyone, my name is John A. Robles Perez. I am a Software Engineering student at the 
        University of Puerto Rico - Mayagüez which is the top one in Engineering around Puerto Rico and also all over 
        United State always has been one of the greatest. Moreover, I have more than 4 years programming and developing
        application experience. In addition, I consider myself a full stack developer which includes experience in front-end,
        back-end, database, DevOps (Development Operations) and mobile application development. However, I have a basic experience 
        in cyber security which in a future I would be excited to work in this area that required a strong knowledge and skills.

    <h2 class="about">About Me</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">My passion about the technology was since my childhood because I just wanted to play electronic games by that time. Then, 
        I grew up and fell in love about videogames as well as soccer. At the age of 8, my mom started to take me play soccer and 
        the rest is history. Been part of the best team by those time in Puerto Rico called Islanders, then the name changed to Bayamon FC, 
        make me develop with a strong mentallity and leadership as the captain. When I was 16 years old, the national team of Puerto Rico called
        me to represent my country and then we travel to Cuba for the qualification to the World Cup U-17. Unfortunately, we finisehd second place
        out of 4, so only the first team of the group qualified for the next stage. Nevertheless, the experience was amazing but give me a lesson that
        you should work harder to be successful in life and never give up. Saying that, for a better future I decided to study something related to
        the technology and now I am about to be a Software Engineering, thank to all the sacrifices and lessons that lifes teach me through 
        the path.</p>
